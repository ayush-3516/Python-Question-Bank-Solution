### **1. Explain Branching in context of Python.(if, else, else...if, break)**

Branching in Python refers to the ability to execute different sets of code based on certain conditions. This control flow feature allows you to make decisions and direct the program's execution down different paths depending on whether specific conditions are true or false.

The primary construct used for branching in Python is the `if-elif-else` statement.
Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. `if` statement:
The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is true
```

2. `elif` statement(optional):

The `elif`(short for "else if") statement allows you to specify additonal conditions to check if the first `if` condition is false.

```python
if condition1:
    # Code to execute if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # Code to execute if condition2 is true
```

3. `else` statement(optional):
The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if none of the preceding conditions are true.

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is true
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is false
```

Here's a practical example that demonstates branching:

```python
x = 10

if x > 15:
    print("x is greater than 15")
elif x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5 but less than 15")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
```

### **2. Discuss Control Structure in context of Python.**

In programming, control structures determine the order in which statements are executed in a program. They allow you to control the flow of execution based on conditions, loops, and function calls. Control structures are essential for creating complex programs and algorithms.

Loops allow a block of code to be executed repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met. Python supports `for` and `while` loops.

**for loop**
```python
for item in iterable:
    # Code to execute for each item in the iterable
```

**while loop**
```python
while condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true
```

### **3. Explain strings and operations on string type.(slicing, indexing, stride, etc..)**

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, and it is one of the fundamental data types used to represent text. Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot modify them in-place; you can only create new strings. Here's an explanation of strings and common operations on them:

**Strings in Python**
A string in Python can be created using single, double, or triple quotes:
```python
string1 = 'This is a string.'
string2 = "This is also a string."
string3 = """This is a multiline
string."""
```

**Accessing Characters in a String(Indexing)**
Every character in a string is associated with an index (position) starting from 0 for the first character. You can access individual characters by their index using square brackets [].
```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Accessing individual characters
print(my_string[0])  # Output: 'H'
print(my_string[7])  # Output: 'W'
```

**Slicing**
Slicing allows you to extract a portion(substring) of a string by specifying a range of indices.
```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"

# Slicing syntax: string[start:end:step]
print(my_string[0:5])   # Output: 'Hello'
print(my_string[7:])    # Output: 'World!'
print(my_string[:5])    # Output: 'Hello'
print(my_string[::2])   # Output: 'Hlo ol!'
```

**Stride**
Stride(also known as a step) is the number of characters to skip while slicing.
```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"

print(my_string[::2])  # Output: 'HloWrd'    
```

**String Length**
You can find the length of a string(the number of characters in the string) using the `len()` function.
```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(len(my_string))  # Output: 13
```

**Concatenation**
Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator.
```python
string1 = "Hello, "
string2 = "World!"
concatenated_string = string1 + string2
print(concatenated_string)  # Output: 'Hello, World!'
```

### **4. Explain User-Defined Functions in Python.**

A user-defined function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task or a set of tasks. Functions help organize and modularize code, making it easier to manage, debug, and reuse. Defining your own functions allows you to create custom operations and functionalities tailored to your specific needs. Here's a detailed explanation of how to define and use user-defined functions in Python:

**Defining a Function**

To define a function in Python, you use the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parenthesis for parameters, a colon, and then the function body, indented appropriately.
```python
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):
    # Function body
    # Code to perform a specific task
    return result  # optional return statement
```

### **5. Explain Argument Passing methods in function.(Positional Arguments/Keyword Arguments/Default Arguments/Variable Length Arguments)**

In Python, when you call a function, you can pass arguments to the function in several ways: positional arguments, keyword arguments, default arguments, and variable-length arguments. These methods give you flexibility in how you provide input to a function. Let's discuss each method in detail:

**1. Positional Arguments:**

Positional arguments are the most common way of passing arguments to a function. The order of the arguments matters, and the values are assigned to the parameters based on their positions.

Example:

```python
def greet(name, greeting):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

# Calling the function using positional arguments
message = greet("Alice", "Hello")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**2. Keyword Arguments:**

Keyword arguments are passed to a function using the format `parameter_name=value`. This method allows you to pass arguments in any order, making the function call more readable and self-explanatory.

Example:

```python
# Calling the function using keyword arguments
message = greet(greeting="Hi", name="Bob")
print(message)  # Output: Hi, Bob!
```

**3. Default Arguments:**

Default arguments have predefined values set in the function definition. If a value is not provided for a parameter during the function call, the default value is used.

Example:

```python
def greet(name, greeting="Hello"):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

# Calling the function without specifying greeting (uses default)
message = greet("Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!

# Calling the function with a custom greeting
message = greet("Alice", "Hi")
print(message)  # Output: Hi, Alice!
```

**4. Variable Length Arguments:**

Python allows functions to accept a variable number of arguments. There are two types of variable-length arguments: arbitrary positional arguments and arbitrary keyword arguments.

a. Arbitrary Positional Arguments:
You can define a function that accepts an arbitrary number of positional arguments using an asterisk (*). These arguments are received as a tuple.

Example:

```python
def sum_all(*args):
    total = 0
    for num in args:
        total += num
    return total

# Calling the function with variable number of arguments
result = sum_all(1, 2, 3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 10
```

b. Arbitrary Keyword Arguments:

You can define a function that accepts an arbitrary number of keyword arguments using double asterisks(`**`). These arguments are recieved as a dictionary.

```python
def display_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Calling the function with variable number of keyword arguments
display_info(name="Alice", age=30, city="New York")
```

### **6. Discuss Scoping in terms of functions with sameple code.(local/Global)**

In Python, scoping refers to the accessibility of variables in different parts of the code. Variables in Python can have either local scope or global scope, depending on where they are defined. Let's discuss local and global scoping in the context of functions and provide sample code for better understanding.

**Local Scope**
Variable defined within a function have a local scope. This means they are accessible only within that function and cannot be accessed outside of it.

```python
def my_function():
    x = 10  # Local variable
    print(x)

my_function()
print(x)  # This will raise a NameError because x is not defined in this scope
```

**Global Scope**
Variables defined outside of any function have a global scope. They can be accessed and modified anywhere in the code.

```python
y = 20  # Global variable

def another_function():
    print(y)

another_function()
print(y)  # Output: 20
```

### **7. Discuss Recursion with example.**

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. This technique allows solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, similar subproblems. In the context of programming, recursion often involves a base case to stop the recursion and prevent an infinite loop.

Here's a detailed explanation of recursion with a simple example in Python: the factorial calculation using recursion.

**Factorial Calculation Using Recursion.**

The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`. Mathematically, `n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1`.

Let's create a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer:

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: factorial of 0 or 1 is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive call to calculate factorial
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Calculate factorial of 5
result = factorial(5)
print("Factorial of 5 is:", result)  # Output: Factorial of 5 is: 120
```

### **8. What is Module in Python? Give detailed description of it with example.**

In Python, a module is a file that contains Python definitions, statements, and functions. Modules allow you to organize code into separate files, making it easier to manage, reuse, and distribute functionality across different parts of a program or different programs. A module can contain variables, functions, classes, and other objects.

**Creating a Module**
To create a module, you simply create a Python file with a `.py` extension. This file will serve as your module, containing the functions, variables, or other elements you want to encapsulate.

Example Module - `my_module.py`:

```python
# my_module.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# This variable is also part of the module
PI = 3.14159
```

In this example, `my_module.py` is a module containing `greet()`, `add()`, and `PI`. These can be imported into other Python scripts for use.

**Importing a Module**
To use the functions and variables from a module in another Python script, you need to import the module using the `import` statement.

Example - Using the Module:

```python
import my_module

# Using functions from the module
print(my_module.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(my_module.add(3, 5))        # Output: 8

# Using variables from the module
print(my_module.PI)               # Output: 3.14159
```

You can also import specific functions or variables from a module using the `from` keyword.

```python
from my_module import greet, PI

print(greet("Bob"))  # Output: Hello, Bob!
print(PI)             # Output: 3.14159
```

### **9. Explain Files and it's access methods in Python.**

In Python, working with files involves reading from and writing to external files on the file system. Files are essential for data storage, data processing, and communication between programs and the external environment. Python provides various methods and functions to work with files, allowing you to read, write, and manage file data effectively.

**File Basics**

- Opening a File

To open a file, you use the `open()` function, specifying the file path and mode (e.g., read, write, append, etc.).

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')  # Opens for reading ('r' is the default mode)
```

Modes for open()

'r': Read (default)

'w': Write (overwrites existing content)

'a': Append (appends to existing content)

'b': Binary mode

't': Text mode (default)

'x': Exclusive creation, if the file already exists, the operation will fail

- Closing a File

It's important to close a file after you're done with it to free up system resources.
```python
file.close()
```

**File Reading**

Reading Entire Contents:
```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()  # Reads the entire content of the file as a string
file.close()
print(content)
```

Reading Lines:
```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
lines = file.readlines()  # Reads the lines of the file and returns a list
file.close()
for line in lines:
    print(line.strip())  # Strips newline characters and prints each line
```

**File Writing**

Writing a File:
```python
file = open('output.txt', 'w')  # Opens for writing
file.write('This is some content.\n')
file.close()
```

Appending to a File:
```python
file = open('output.txt', 'a')  # Opens for appending
file.write('This is additional content.\n')
file.close()
```

**File Iteration**

You can interate through lines in a file directly using a `for` loop.
```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
for line in file:
    print(line.strip())
file.close()
```

**Using `with` statement**
The `with` statement automatically closes the file after exiting the block, even if an exception occurs.
```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

**File Methods and Attributes**

`read(size)`: Reads and returns size number of bytes from the file.

`readline()`: Reads a line from the file.

`readlines()`: Reads all lines of the file and returns them as a list.

`write(string)`: Writes the string to the file.

`tell()`: Returns the current file pointer position.

`seek(offset, from)`: Moves the file pointer to a specified position (from the beginning, end, or current position).

**Binary Files**

To work with binary files, you can use the 'b' mode and read/write binary data.

```python
with open('binary_file.bin', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(b'Binary data')
```

### **10. Explain Function as Object in Python.**

OR

### **10. How function can be passed as Object? And compare it with map().**

In Python, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any other object. This includes passing functions as arguments to other functions, returning functions from functions, and storing them in data structures. This powerful feature allows for functional programming paradigms and enhances the flexibility and expressiveness of the language.

**Passing a Function as an Object**
Here's an example demonstrating how to pass a function as an object (argument) to another function:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def process_greeting(greeter, name):
    return greeter(name)

# Pass the greet function as an argument to process_greeting
message = process_greeting(greet, "Alice")
print(message)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

**Comparison with `map()`**

`map()` is a built-in Python function that allows you to apply a specified function to every item in an iterable (e.g., a list) and return an iterator that yields the results.

Here's an example of using `map()` to apply a function to a list of names:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]

# Using map to apply the greet function to each name in the list
greetings = map(greet, names)

# Convert the map iterator to a list to see the results
greetings_list = list(greetings)
print(greetings_list)
# Output: ['Hello, Alice!', 'Hello, Bob!', 'Hello, Charlie!']
```

### **11. Differentiate following functions: (i)lambda. (2)map. (3)filter.**

In Python, `lambda`, `map`, and `filter` are functional programming constructs used for data manipulation and transformation. Each serves a different purpose and has distinct characteristics:

**Lambda Functions**
- Purpose: Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are used to create small, one-time-use functions without a formal function definition.

- Syntax: `lambda arguments: expression`

- Example:
```python
square = lambda x: x**2
print(square(5))  # Output: 25
```

- Characteristics:
    - Concise and ofter used in simple operations.
    - Cannot contain multiple expressions or statements.
    - Typically used for short, one-line operations.

**Map**

- Purpose: The `map()` function is used to apply a given function to each element in an iterable(e.g., a list) and returns an iterator that yields the transformed elements.

- Syntax: `map(function, iterable(s))`

- Example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
double_numbers = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)
print(list(double_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

- Characteristics:
    - Applies a function to each element in the iterable.
    - Returns an iterator, so it's memory efficient for large datasets.
    - Tyically used for element-wise transformations.

**Filter**

- Purpose: The `filter()` function is used to construct an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.

- Syntax: `filter(function, iterable)`

- Example:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)
print(list(even_numbers))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

- Characteristics:
    - Filters elements based on the provided function(which should return a boolean).
    - Returns an iterator, so it's memory  efficient for large datasets.
    - Typically used for filtering based on a condition.

-------- OR ---------

### **11. Explain Higher Order Functions supported by Python.**

In Python, a higher-order function is a function that meets at least one of the following criteria:

1. Takes a Function as an Argument:

The higher-order function takes one or more functions as arguments.

2. Returns a Function:

The higher-order function returns a function as its result.

Higher-order functions are a fundamental concept in functional programming and provide a powerful way to abstract and compose functionality.

Example 1: Function as an Argument

```python
def apply_operation(operation, x):
    return operation(x)

def double(x):
    return 2 * x

def square(x):
    return x ** 2

result1 = apply_operation(double, 3)  # Passing 'double' function
result2 = apply_operation(square, 4)  # Passing 'square' function

print(result1)  # Output: 6
print(result2)  # Output: 16
```

Example 2: Function as a Result

```python
def make_adder(n):
    def adder(x):
        return x + n
    return adder

add_5 = make_adder(5)
add_10 = make_adder(10)

result1 = add_5(3)  # Output: 8
result2 = add_10(3)  # Output: 13

print(result1)
print(result2)
```

### **12. What is known as Mutability? Which are mutable types?**

In programming, mutability refers to the ability of an object or data structure to be changed or modified after its creation. If a data type or object is mutable, it means that its state can be altered, elements can be added or removed, and its contents can be modified in-place without creating a new instance.

Conversely, immutability refers to the characteristic of not being able to be changed after creation. Immutable objects cannot have their state altered once they are created.

**Mutable Types in Python**

In Python, some data types are mutable, meaning they can be modified after creation, while others are immutable and cannot be changed. Here are some common examples of mutable and immutable types in Python:

Mutable Types:

1. Lists (`list`):

Lists are ordered collections of items, and their elements can be modified, added, or removed after creation.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 5  # Modifying an element
my_list.append(4)  # Adding an element
```

2. Dictionaries(`dict`):

Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs, and their keys and values can be modified, added, or removed.
```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
my_dict['age'] = 31  # Modifying a value
my_dict['city'] = 'New York'  # Adding a key-value pair
```

3. Sets(`set`):

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements, and their elements can be modified or added.
```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(4)  # Adding an element
```

### **13. Differentiate between Strings, Tuples, Lists, and Dictionaries.**

**Strings (`str`)**
- Description:
    - A string is an ordered collection of characters.
    - Immutable: Strings cannot be modified once created; you can only create new strings.
- Example:
```python
my_str = "Hello, World!"
```
- Properties:
    - Ordered: Characters have a specific order and can be accessed by index.
    - Immutable: You cannot modify a string in-place.
    - Iterable: You can iterate over the characters in a string.

**Tuples (`tuple`)**
- Description:
    - A tuple is an ordered collection of elements, which can be of any data type.
    - Immutable: Tuples cannot be modified once created; you can only create new tuples.
- Example:
```python
my_tuple = (1, "Alice", 3.14)
```
- Properties:
    - Ordered: Elements have a specific order and can be accessed by index.
    - Immutable: You cannot modify a tuple in-place.
    - Iterable: You can iterate over the elements in a tuple.

**Lists (`list`)**
- Description:
    - A list is an ordered collection of elements, which can be of any data type.
    - Mutable: Lists can be modified by adding, removing, or changing elements in-place.
- Example:
```python
my_list = [1, "Alice", 3.14]
```
- Properties:
    - Ordered: Elements have a specific order and can be accessed by index.
    - Mutable: You can modify a list in-place by adding, removing, or changing elements.
    - Iterable: You can iterate over the elements in a list.

**Dictionaries (`dict`)**
- Description:
    - A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
    - Mutable: Dictionaries can be modified by adding, removing, or changing key-value pairs.
- Example:
```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
```
- Properties:
    - Unordered: Key-value pairs do not have a specific order and cannot be accessed by index.
    - Mutable: You can modify a dictionary in-place by adding, removing, or changing key-value pairs.
    - Iterable: You can iterate over the keys, values, or key-value pairs in a dictionary.

### **14. List out operations on Strings, Tuples, Lists and Dictionaries.**

**Strings (`str`)**

1. Concatenation:

Joining two or more strings together.

Example:
```python
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2  # Output: "Hello World"
```

2. Indexing:

Accessing elements in a tuple using their indices.

Example:
```python
my_str = "Python"
print(my_str[0])  # Output: 'P'
```

3. Slicing:

Extracting a portion of the string.

Example:
```python
my_str = "Hello, World!"
print(my_str[7:12])  # Output: "World"
```

4. Length:

Getting the length of the string.

Example:
```python
my_str = "Hello"
print(len(my_str))  # Output: 5
```

5. Membership:

Checking if a substring is present in the string.

Example:
```python
my_str = "Hello, World!"
print("World" in my_str)  # Output: True
```

6. Conversion:

Converting a string to uppercase, lowercase, or titlecase.

Example:
```python
my_str = "hello"
print(my_str.upper())  # Output: "HELLO"
print(my_str.lower())  # Output: "hello"
print(my_str.title())  # Output: "Hello"
```

7. Splitting and Joining:

Splitting a string into a list of substrings or joining a list of strings into a single string.

Example:
```python
my_str = "apple,banana,cherry"
split_result = my_str.split(",")  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
join_result = "-".join(split_result)  # Output: "apple-banana-cherry"
```

**Tuples (`tuple`)**

1. Indexing:

Accessing elements in a tuple using their indices.

Example:
```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 10
```

2. Slicing:

Extracting a portion of the tuple.

Example:
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple[1:4])  # Output: (2, 3, 4)
```

3. Length:

Example:
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(len(my_tuple))  # Output: 3
```

4. Membership:

Checking in an element is present in the tuple.

Example:

```

**Lists (`list`)**

1. Append and Extend:

Adding elements to a list.

Example:

my_list.extend([5, 6, 7])  # Extends the list with another list
```

2. Insert:

Inserting an element at a specific position in the list.

Example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.insert(1, 10)  # Inserts 10 at index 1
```

3. Remove and Pop:

Removing elements from the list.

Example:
```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
my_list.remove(20)  # Removes the specified element
my_list.pop(0)  # Removes and returns the element at the specified index
```

4. Index and Count:

Finding the index of an element and counting occurrences.

Example:

2. Keys, Values, and Items:

Getting keys, values, and key-value pairs from a dictionary.

Example:
```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(my_dict.keys())  # Output: dict_keys(['name', 'age'])
print(my_dict.values())  # Output: dict_values(['Alice', 30])

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
my_dict["city"] = "New York"  # Adding a new key-value pair
my_dict["age"] = 31  # Modifying an existing value
del my_dict["name"]  # Removing a key-value pair
```

4. Membership:

Checking if a key is present in the dictionary.

Example:

my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print("name" in my_dict)  # Output: True
```

### **15. What is Cloning? Describe methods to overcome it.**

Cloning, in the context of data structures and objects, refers to the process of creating a copy of an existing object or data structure. When you clone an object, you create a new object that has the same content (values) as the original, but is a distinct entity in memory. Cloning is important to avoid unintended modifications to the original object when working with its copy.

In Python, the concept of cloning is relevant mainly for mutable objects like lists, dictionaries, and custom objects, since they can be modified in-place.

**Methods to Overcome Cloning Issues:**
1. Shallow Copy:

- A shallow copy creates a new object that is a duplicate of the original object, but it doesn't create copies of the objects inside the original object (e.g., elements of a list).
- Use the copy() method for lists, dictionaries, and other mutable objects to create a shallow copy.
- Shallow copy can still have issues if the original object contains mutable objects.

```python
import copy

original_list = [1, [2, 3]]
shallow_copy = copy.copy(original_list)

shallow_copy[1][0] = 5  # This will affect the original list too
```

2. Deep Copy:

- A deep copy creates a new object that is a duplicate of the original object, including all objects inside it (recursively).
- Use the `deepcopy()` method from the copy module for creating deep copies.

```python
import copy

original_list = [1, [2, 3]]
deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original_list)

deep_copy[1][0] = 5  # This won't affect the original list
```

3. Slice Operator (for Lists):

- Using the slice operator ([:]) can create a shallow copy of a list.
- This works specifically for lists and provides a simple way to create a new list with the same elements.

```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
shallow_copy = original_list[:]

shallow_copy[0] = 5  # This won't affect the original list
```

4. Constructors(for Lists and Dictionaries):

- Creating a new list or dictionary using the constructor of the respective type can also achieve a shallow copy.

```python
original_list = [1, 2, 3]
shallow_copy = list(original_list)  # Shallow copy using list constructor

original_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
shallow_copy_dict = dict(original_dict)  # Shallow copy using dict constructor
```

5. Custom Cloning(for Custom Objects):

- Implement a custom method within your class to create a new instance and copy relevant attributes or data.

```python
class CustomObject:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def clone(self):
        return CustomObject(self.value)

original_obj = CustomObject(42)
cloned_obj = original_obj.clone()
```

### **16. Explain Membership Operator with example.**

Membership operators in Python are used to test for membership in a sequence, such as strings, lists, tuples, or dictionaries. There are two membership operators: `in` and `not in`.

`in` Operator
The `in` operator checks if a value exists in a sequence. It returns `True` if the value is present and `False` otherwise.

Syntax:

```python
value in sequence
```

Example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(3 in my_list)  # Output: True
print(6 in my_list)  # Output: False
```

not in Operator
The not in operator checks if a value does not exist in a sequence. It returns True if the value is not present and False otherwise.

Syntax:not in Operator
The not in operator checks if a value does not exist in a sequence. It returns True if the value is not present and False otherwise.

Syntax:
```python
value not in sequence
```

Example:

```python
my_str = "Hello, World!"

print('H' not in my_str)  # Output: False
print('x' not in my_str)  # Output: True
```

## Unit - 2

### **17. List and explain types of Inheritance in python with example.**

**Single Inheritance** Single inheritance allows a derivate class to inherit properties of one parent class, and this allows code reuse and the introduction of additional features in existing code.

```python
class Parent1:  
    def func_1(self):  
        print ("This function is defined inside the parent class.")  
  
class Child1(Parent1):  
    def func_2(self):  
        print ("This function is defined inside the child class.")  
  
# Driver's code  
object = Child1()  
object.func_1()  
object.func_2() 
```
Output:
```
This function is defined inside the parent class.
This function is defined inside the child class.
```

**Multiple Inheritance** If a class is able to be created from multiple base classes, this kind of Inheritance is known as multiple Inheritance. When there is multiple Inheritance, each of the attributes that are present in the classes of the base has been passed on to the class that is derived from it.

```python
class Mother1:  
    mothername1 = ""  
    def mother1(self):  
        print(self.mothername1)  
  
class Father1:  
    fathername1 = ""  
    def father1(self):  
        print(self.fathername1)  
  
class Son1(Mother1, Father1):  
    def parents1(self):  
        print ("Father name is :", self.fathername1)  
        print ("Mother name is :", self.mothername1)  
  
s1 = Son1()  
s1.fathername1 = "Rajesh"  
s1.mothername1 = "Shreya"  
s1.parents1() 
```
Output:
```
Father name is: Rajesh
Mother name is: Shreya
```

**Multilevel inheritance**, the features that are part of the original class, as well as the class that is derived from it, are passed on to the new class. It is similar to a relationship involving grandparents and children.

```python
class Grandfather1:  
  
    def __init__(self, grandfathername1):  
        self.grandfathername1 = grandfathername1  
  
class Father1(Grandfather1):  
    def __init__(self, fathername1, grandfathername1):  
        self.fathername1 = fathername1  
  
        Grandfather1.__init__(self, grandfathername1)  
  
class Son1(Father1):  
    def __init__(self,sonname1, fathername1, grandfathername1):  
        self.sonname1 = sonname1  
  
        Father1.__init__(self, fathername1, grandfathername1)  
  
    def print_name(self):  
        print('Grandfather name is :', self.grandfathername1)  
        print("Father name is :", self.fathername1)  
        print("Son name is :", self.sonname1)  
  
s1 = Son1('John', 'John Jr', 'John Jr Jr')  
print (s1.grandfathername1)  
s1.print_name() 
```
Output:
```
John Jr Jr
Grandfather name is : John Jr Jr
Father name is : John Jr
Son name is : John
```

**Hierarchical Inheritance** If multiple derived classes are created from the same base, this kind of Inheritance is known as hierarchical inheritance. In this instance, we have two base classes as a parent (base) class as well as two children (derived) classes.

```python
class Parent1:  
    def func_1(self):  
        print ("This function is defined inside the parent class.")  
  
class Child_1(Parent1):  
    def func_2(self):  
        print ("This function is defined inside the child 1.")  
  
class Child_2(Parent1):  
    def func_3(self):  
        print ("This function is defined inside the child 2.")  
  
object1 = Child_1()  
object2 = Child_2()  
object1.func_1()  
object1.func_2()  
object2.func_1()  
object2.func_3() 
```
Output:
```
This function is defined inside the parent class.
This function is defined inside the child 1.
This function is defined inside the parent class.
This function is defined inside the child 2.
```

### **18. Explain Data Abstraction/Data Hiding.**

Data abstraction that hides complex implementation details while exposing only essential information and functionalities to users. In Python, we can achieve data abstraction by using abstract classes and abstract classes can be created using abc (abstract base class) module and abstractmethod of abc module.

As a property, abstract classes can have any number of abstract methods coexisting with any number of other methods. 

Abstract methods do not contain any implementation. Instead, all the implementations can be defined in the methods of sub-classes that inherit the abstract class.

Implementation of Data Abstraction in Python:

In the below code, we have implemented data abstraction using abstract class and method. Firstly, we import the required modules or classes from abc library then we create a base class ‘Car’ that inherited from ‘ABC’ class that we have imported. Inside base class we create init function, abstract function and non-abstract functions. To declare abstract function printDetails we use “@abstractmethod” decorator. After that we create child class hatchback and suv. Since, these child classes inherited from abstract class so, we need to write the implementation of all abstract function declared in the base class. We write the implementation of abstract method in both child class. We create an instance of a child class and call the printDetails method. In this way we can achieve the data abstraction.

```python
# Import required modules
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Create Abstract base class
class Car(ABC):
def __init__(self, brand, model, year):
	self.brand = brand
	self.model = model
	self.year = year
	
# Create abstract method	 
@abstractmethod
def printDetails(self):
	pass

# Create concrete method
def accelerate(self):
	print("speed up ...")

def break_applied(self):
	print("Car stop")
	
# Create a child class
class Hatchback(Car):

def printDetails(self):
	print("Brand:", self.brand);
	print("Model:", self.model);
	print("Year:", self.year);

def Sunroof(self):
	print("Not having this feature")
	
# Create a child class
class Suv(Car):

def printDetails(self):
	print("Brand:", self.brand);
	print("Model:", self.model);
	print("Year:", self.year);

def Sunroof(self):
	print("Available")

	
car1 = Hatchback("Maruti", "Alto", "2022");

car1.printDetails()
car1.accelerate()

```
Output:
```python
Brand: Maruti
Model: Alto
Year: 2022
speed up ...
```

### **19. Explain `isinstance()` method.**

The isinstance() function returns True if the specified object is of the specified type, otherwise False.

```python
x = isinstance("Hello", (str, float, int, str, list, dict, tuple))

print(x) # True
```

### **20. Explain Method Overriding in Python.**

Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.

```python
# Python program to demonstrate 
# method overriding 


# Defining parent class 
class Parent(): 
	
	# Constructor 
	def __init__(self): 
		self.value = "Inside Parent"
		
	# Parent's show method 
	def show(self): 
		print(self.value) 
		
# Defining child class 
class Child(Parent): 
	
	# Constructor 
	def __init__(self): 
		self.value = "Inside Child"
		
	# Child's show method 
	def show(self): 
		print(self.value) 
		
		
# Driver's code 
obj1 = Parent() 
obj2 = Child() 

obj1.show() 
obj2.show() 
```

Output:
```
Inside Parent
Inside Child
```

### **21. Explain `issubclass()` method in python.**

The issubclass() function returns True if the specified object is a subclass of the specified object, otherwise False.

```python
class myAge:
  age = 36

class myObj(myAge):
  name = "John"
  age = myAge

x = issubclass(myObj, myAge)

print(x) # True
```

### **22. Discuss Encapsulation.**

Encapsulation is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.

```python
class Students:
   def __init__(self, name, rank, points):
      self.name = name
      self.rank = rank
      self.points = points

   # custom function
   def demofunc(self):
      print("I am "+self.name)
      print("I got Rank ",+self.rank)

# create 4 objects
st1 = Students("Steve", 1, 100)
st2 = Students("Chris", 2, 90)
st3 = Students("Mark", 3, 76)
st4 = Students("Kate", 4, 60)

# call the functions using the objects created above
st1.demofunc()
st2.demofunc()
st3.demofunc()
st4.demofunc()
```
Output:
```
I am Steve
I got Rank  1
I am Chris
I got Rank  2
I am Mark
I got Rank  3
I am Kate
I got Rank  4
```

### **23. Implementation of Linear Search/Binary Search(Recursive/Non-Recursive).**

**Linear Search**

# Linear Search in Python

```python
def linearSearch(array, n, x):

    # Going through array sequencially
    for i in range(0, n):
        if (array[i] == x):
            return i
    return -1


array = [2, 4, 0, 1, 9]
x = 1
n = len(array)
result = linearSearch(array, n, x)
if(result == -1):
    print("Element not found")
else:
    print("Element found at index: ", result)
```

**Binary Search(Recursive)**

```python
def binary_search(my_list, low, high, elem):
    if high >= low:
 
        mid = (high + low) // 2
 
        if my_list[mid] == elem:
            return mid
 
        elif my_list[mid] > elem:
            return binary_search(my_list, low, mid - 1, elem)
 
        else:
            return binary_search(my_list, mid + 1, high, elem)
 
    else:
        return -1
        
my_list = [ 1, 9, 11, 21, 34, 54, 67, 90 ]
elem_to_search = 1
print("The list is")
print(my_list)

my_result = binary_search(my_list,0,len(my_list)-1,elem_to_search)
 
if my_result != -1:
    print("Element found at index ", str(my_result))
else:
    print("Element not found!")
```
Output:
```
The list is
[1, 9, 11, 21, 34, 54, 67, 90]
Element found at index 0
```

**Binary Search(Non-Recursive)**

```python
def binary_search(my_list, elem):
    low = 0
    high = len(my_list) - 1
    mid = 0
 
    while low <= high:
 
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if my_list[mid] < elem:
            low = mid + 1
 
        elif my_list[mid] > elem:
            high = mid - 1
 
        else:
            return mid
 
    return -1
 
my_list = [ 1, 9, 11, 21, 34, 54, 67, 90 ]
elem_to_search = 1
print("The list is")
print(my_list)

my_result = binary_search(my_list, elem_to_search)
 
if my_result != -1:
    print("Element found at index ", str(my_result))
else:
    print("Element not found!")
```
Output:
```
The list is
[1, 9, 11, 21, 34, 54, 67, 90]
Element found at index  0
```

### **24. Explain Wrapper Function in Python.**

wrappers are the functionality available in Python to wrap a function with another function to extend its behavior. Now, the reason to use wrappers in our code lies in the fact that we can modify a wrapped function without actually changing it. They are also known as decorators.

```python

# defining decorator function named as function1
def function2(function1):
  # defining wrapper function
  def wrapper_function():
    return function1()
  return wrapper_function
 
# Function we want to wrap
def function1():
  print("This is wrapped function.")
 
# Holds the returned function in a variable
var = function2(function1)
# executing var function
var()
```
Output:
```
This is wrapped function.
```

### **25. Write a code to implement divide and conquer/merge sort/selection sort.

**Merge Sort**

```python
def mergeSort(array):
    if len(array) > 1:

        #  r is the point where the array is divided into two subarrays
        r = len(array)//2
        L = array[:r]
        M = array[r:]

        # Sort the two halves
        mergeSort(L)
        mergeSort(M)

        i = j = k = 0

        # Until we reach either end of either L or M, pick larger among
        # elements L and M and place them in the correct position at A[p..r]
        while i < len(L) and j < len(M):
            if L[i] < M[j]:
                array[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                array[k] = M[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        # When we run out of elements in either L or M,
        # pick up the remaining elements and put in A[p..r]
        while i < len(L):
            array[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(M):
            array[k] = M[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1


# Print the array
def printList(array):
    for i in range(len(array)):
        print(array[i], end=" ")
    print()


# Driver program
if __name__ == '__main__':
    array = [6, 5, 12, 10, 9, 1]

    mergeSort(array)

    print("Sorted array is: ")
    printList(array)

```

Output:
```
Sorted array is:
1 5 6 9 10 12
```

**Selection Sort**

```python
# Selection sort in Python


def selectionSort(array, size):
   
    for step in range(size):
        min_idx = step

        for i in range(step + 1, size):
         
            # to sort in descending order, change > to < in this line
            # select the minimum element in each loop
            if array[i] < array[min_idx]:
                min_idx = i
         
        # put min at the correct position
        (array[step], array[min_idx]) = (array[min_idx], array[step])


data = [-2, 45, 0, 11, -9]
size = len(data)
selectionSort(data, size)
print('Sorted Array in Ascending Order:')
print(data)
```
Output:
```
Sorted Array in Ascending Order:
[-9, -2, 0, 11, 45]
```

### **26. Write a code for implement tim sort.**

### **27. Linked list concept in python.**

A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library.

```python

### **28. Describe methods of RegEx in python.**

A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

Python has a built-in package called `re`, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.

The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:

`findall` - returns a list containing all matches.

```python
import re

#Return a list containing every occurrence of "ai":

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.findall("ai", txt)
print(x)
```
Output:
```
['ai', 'ai']
```

`search` - searches for a match, and returns a Match object if there is a match.

If there is more than one match, only the first occurence of the match will be returned. If no matches are found, the value None is returned.

```python
import re

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.search("\s", txt)

print("The first white-space character is located in position:", x.start()) 

```
Output:
```
The first white-space character is located in position: 3
```

`split` - returns a list where the string has been split at each match.

```python
import re

#Split the string at every white-space character:

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.split("\s", txt)
print(x)
```
Output:
```
['The', 'rain', 'in', 'Spain']
```

`sub` - replaces the matches with the text of your choice.

```python
import re

#Replace all white-space characters with the digit "9":

txt = "The rain in Spain"
x = re.sub("\s", "9", txt)
print(x)
```
Output:
```
The9rain9in9Spain
```

### **29. Types of Pattern Matching in Python RegEx.**

- Literal Characters: You can match literal characters by including them in the pattern. For example, the pattern "cat" will match the string "cat" in the input.

```python
import re

pattern = re.compile(r'cat')
result = pattern.match('concatenation')
```

- Character Classes: Character classes allow you to match any one of a set of characters. For example, the pattern [aeiou] will match any vowel.

```python
import re

pattern = re.compile(r'[aeiou]')
result = pattern.search('apple')
```

- Quantifiers: Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or group. For example, + matches one or more occurrences, * matches zero or more occurrences, and ? matches zero or one occurrence.

```python
import re

pattern = re.compile(r'\d+')  # Matches one or more digits
result = pattern.search('12345')
```

- Anchors: Anchors are used to specify the position of a match in the input string. `^` matches the start of a string, and `$` matches the end.

```python
import re

pattern = re.compile(r'^start')
result = pattern.match('start of something')
```
