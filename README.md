## Unit 1 - HTML

**1. What is a Web Browser? Difference between URL and Domain Name?**

Web Browser is a client, program, software, or tool through which we sent HTTP request to web server. The main purpose of Web Browser is to locate the content on the World Wide Web and display in the shape of web page, images, audio or video form.

A URL(Uniform Resource Locator) is a unique identifier used to locate a resource on the internet. It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.

End users use URLs by typing them directly into the address bar of a browseror by clicking a hyperlink found on a webpage, bookmark list, in an email list, or from another application.

A domain name is a human-readable address used to access website on the internet. It provides a way to easily remember and access a particular web server.

In summary, a URL is a complete address that specifies the location and resource on the Internet, while a domain name is a part of that address that helps users easily identify and access a particular website.

**2. What is a Client-Side Scripting? What is Server-Side Scripting? And Differentiate.**

Client-Side Scripting involves executing scripts or code on the user's web browser. The client(web browser) processes and runs these scripts without needing to communicate with the server. Common languages used for client-side scripting  include Javascirpt, HTML, and CSS.

Server-Side Scripting involves executing scripts or code on the web server. The server processes the scripts and generates HTML, which is then sent to the user's browser. Common server-side scripting languages are PHP, Python(with frameworks like Django or Flask), Ruby(with Ruby on Rails), and Node.js(Javascript on the server-side).

| | Client Side Scripting | Server Side Scripting |
|-----|------|-----|
| Execution Location | User's browser. | Web Server. |
| Control and Security |Users have to access to the code and can potentially modify it, making it less secure for critical operations. |Code and operations are executed on the server, providing better control and security. |
| Responsiveness and Performance | Enhances responsiveness and usre experience by reducing the need for server interactions for minor updates. | Performance can be affected by network latency and server processing time, but it's essential for handling complex operations and security. |
