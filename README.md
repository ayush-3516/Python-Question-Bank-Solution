**1. Explain Branching in context of Python.(if, else, else...if, break)**

Branching in Python refers to the ability to execute different sets of code based on certain conditions. This control flow feature allows you to make decisions and direct the program's execution down different paths depending on whether specific conditions are true or false.

The primary construct used for branching in Python is the `if-elif-else` statement.
Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.

```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is true
```
